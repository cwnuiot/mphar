CWNU-MRD Dataset
1.Data collection environment

Devices：

                Reader：Impinj R420

                Antenna：Larid S9028PCR

                Tag：Impinj M4E

Ground：

                3.5m (length) × 3.2m (width) × 4.5m (height)

Volunteers:

     This research team recruited fourteen volunteers with different conditions (age 18-24, height 155-182cm, weight 46-95kg, ratio of male to female 8:6). The volunteers complete twenty two human activities in multipath environment. Each activity was repeated about 40 times by each volunteer.
2.An example of data

     Each tag response record in the dataset includes the EPC(The first four digits are used as the identity of the person to be tested, and the last four digits are used as the attachment position of the tag), antenna number, timestamp, Dopler Frequency, RSSI, Phase, and the activity number (label) used to identify the activity.
